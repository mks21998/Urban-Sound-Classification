# Urban-Sound-Classification
Let us have a better practical overview in a real life project, the Urban Sound challenge. This practice problem is meant to introduce you to audio processing in the usual classification scenario.

The dataset contains 8732 sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes, namely:

air conditioner,
car horn,
children playing,
dog bark,
drilling,
engine idling,
gun shot,
jackhammer,
siren, and
street music
Hereâ€™s a sound excerpt from the dataset. Can you guess which class does it belong to?
